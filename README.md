# Surfs_UP - Module 9 Challenge
Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval
I need to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- The purpose of the analysis is to review the weather to determine the behavior of the weather to provide a recommendation to whether or not to open a Surf Shop. This Suf Shop will also sell ice cream, that is why it is important to show data on the cold and hot days, as well as to know the temperature. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. 

1. June and December temperatures are relatively similar, which indicates that the Surf Shop business in Oahu is going to be a good one.

- The average temperatures for June are:
* 25% - 73 degrees.
* 50% - 75 degrees.
* 75% - 77 degrees.
* The mean temperature is 74.9 degrees.

- The average temperatures for December are:
* 25% - 69 degrees.
* 50% - 71 degrees.

We can determine that temperatures are relatively similar in both months, June considered for the best month where sunny days are more expected, and considering December the bad month for having lower temperatures, however, since the mean temperature only varies by 4 degrees we can stay both months are similar and will do just fine with the ice cream business.

2. Hot and cold days for both June and December are important to consider, since those are to be expected to be the best and worst days for people to wanna grab an ice cream.

- The max temperature for June is 85 degrees.
- The min temperature for June is 64 degrees.
- The max temperature for December is 83 degrees.
- The min temperature for December is 56 degrees.

- There are more hot days in June than in December, however, in both months we can see again that the weather is almost standard throughout the months, with slight variances, although the decreases in December according to are greater from December 5 to 10.
- There are more cold days in June, however, in December there are constant ups and downs of cold days throughout the month.

3. Precipitation days are key for the Surf Shop business in Oahu, because those days will practically be death to the surf and ice cream business.

- In the month of June there were more rains than in previous years in December, we observe that the data for 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2016 shows unusual picks in the precipitation behavior in some of the months.
- The lowest month with rain in Oahu is April and May. These months will then represent the best profitable months for the Surf and ice cream business.
- The year 2017 is left out because of missing information in some months 

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

- The average precipitation summary, as well as the average temperature per month, were two additional scripts that helped out our analysis on the business profitability of the Surf Shop business in Oahu.
- Look at the average temperatures per month graph in the month of June, the temperature is increasing, This will benefit the ice cream business. This is the best time to open the shop because Ice cream sell will definitely be good. Since in December the average temperature lowers, it is best to not open the shop in December.

- Look at theaverage precipitation per month graph in the month of June there were more rains in previous years than in December. The lowest month with rain in Oahu is April and May. These month will then represent the best profitable months for the Surf and ice cream business.
